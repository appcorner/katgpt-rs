//! Loop-straightness trajectory diagnostics — the DEC-native stalemate signal
//! (Issue 922; LiFT appendix C, arXiv:2610.05538, modelless extraction).
//!
//! For any iterative refinement trajectory `x_0 → x_1 → … → x_K` with deltas
//! `Δ_k = x_{k+1} − x_k` on grid weights `δ_k > 0`:
//!
//! ```text
//! A_disc = ½·Σ_k ‖Δ_k‖²/δ_k  ≥  ½·‖x_K − x_0‖²/Σ_k δ_k   (Cauchy–Schwarz)
//! η      = ‖x_K − x_0‖² / (Σ_k ‖Δ_k‖²/δ_k · Σ_k δ_k)  ∈ (0, 1]
//! ```
//!
//! (The ½ cancels in the ratio; [`path_action`] reports the un-halved sum so
//! the floor reads directly off its two outputs.)
//!
//! - `η = 1` **iff** the path is straight at constant grid-speed
//!   (`Δ_k = c·δ_k·u` for a fixed unit direction `u`) — exact in `f32` on
//!   dyadic grids, which is the G1 straightness pin.
//! - `1 − η` is the exact wasted-motion fraction (backtracking, orbiting,
//!   A/B/A oscillation): motion that cancelled itself.
//! - **Grid-invariant**: the identity holds on ANY nonuniform positive grid
//!   (knot-wise minimizer of the weighted action), so a nonuniform
//!   deliberation schedule admits the same diagnostic — `η` normalizes by
//!   `Σδ` internally and never assumes the caller's weights sum to 1.
//! - **Boundary-vs-interior**: the floor reads only the two endpoints; the
//!   cost samples K interior knots. The summation axis is K, not the latent
//!   dim — no curse of dimensionality (the manifold-geometry rule).
//!
//! This is the PRIMITIVE half; consumers (riir-ai Issue 1037: deliberation
//! cadence, cgsp collapse bridge, refine self-evolve, reflex cascade) feed it
//! trajectory logs the runtime already traverses. The stalemate LAW stays the
//! consumer's: a signal, never a counter-forced action — `1 − η` feeds a
//! sigmoid drive there, it never gates here.
//!
//! Signal-diff (pre-implementation, recorded in Issue 922): every shipped
//! cousin is a COUNTER or an ENTROPY read, none is geometric —
//! `swarm/deliberation.rs` counts consecutive flee ticks (the gapped
//! oscillator), `cgsp_runtime` reads solver entropy collapse
//! (`EntropyCollapse`/`CollapseSignal`), `latent_functor` classifies crowd
//! regimes (`NoiseSustainedOscillation`), refine `self_evolve` reads
//! trajectory outcomes. No workspace code computes the action floor, η, or a
//! chord projection over a refinement trajectory.
//!
//! Zero-alloc by construction: caller-supplied slices only, no `Vec`, no
//! iteration-order dependence beyond the path's own order (which IS the
//! signal). NaN propagates (a consumer checking `η.is_finite()` is cheaper
//! than this module guessing a sentinel).
