//! Affine strong−weak contrast combine — the one home for the
//! `strong + ω·(strong − weak)` / convex-blend arithmetic family.
//!
//! Extracted from `katgpt-forward::d2f_context::apply_probe_guidance`
//! (Issue 865, Plan 617 T1.2) so that BOTH consumers share one
//! formula-preserving kernel:
//!
//! - **865 probe guidance** (the D2F decode lane): convex blend
//!   `logits' = λ·logits + (1−λ)·probe_logits` with `λ ∈ [0, 1]`.
//! - **LoopCD recurrent-depth contrast** (Plan 617, feature
//!   `loop_guidance`): extrapolation `z′ = z_R + ω·(z_R − z_k)`, which is
//!   the same affine family at `λ = 1 + ω` (ω ≥ 0 → λ ≥ 1): the negative
//!   weight on the weak side is exactly the `(1−λ)` coefficient.
//!
//! The kernel is pure arithmetic over caller slices — no context type, no
//! allocation, no platform code. Gated
//! `any(feature = "probe_guidance", feature = "loop_guidance")` so a build
//! carrying neither consumer compiles it to nothing (the feature-gate
//! discipline); each root feature forwards its core twin.
//!
//! # Bit-identity contract
//!
//! `out[i] ← lam·out[i] + (1−lam)·ref[i]` evaluated in exactly that order,
//! the `(1−lam)` weight hoisted once outside the loop (the Issue-865 form).
//! The 865 combine-kernel tests pin exact equality against the pre-extraction
//! arithmetic; any reassociation here is a formula break, not a refactor.
