//! LatticeMemory — E2LSH-addressed delta-rule cell lattice (Plan 619).
//!
//! The deterministic, modelless extraction of the Spotlight-class addressing
//! math (research note 233): a 2D lattice of delta-rule cells addressed by
//! **continuous E2LSH per-axis coordinates** (`address`), bump-interpolated
//! over the 3×3 neighborhood (`bump`), cells allocated on first write into a
//! preallocated flat slab (`types`) — the candidate fifth retrieval
//! complexity class (growing state + constant-neighborhood access + graded
//! near-miss recall) beside Raven O(1) / Engram O(1) / δ-Mem O(r) / PKM
//! O(√N).
//!
//! T1.4 arms the cells with the closed-form delta rule
//! `S ← (I − βkkᵀ)S + βkvᵀ` (rank-1 removal along the key + rank-1 add, two
//! `d_k·d_v` MAC passes, no gradient descent) and the per-cell
//! read-then-blend read `Σ φ_c·(S_cᵀ q)`. T1.5 adds the occupancy-warped
//! sizer (`sizer` + `cdf`); T1.6 the sigmoid-only scoring read.
//!
//! Opt-in (`feature = "lattice_memory"`) until the Plan 619 GOAT gate
//! (T1.7) passes; the gate designs live in the plan, never here. Name
//! disambiguation: NOT `analytic_lattice` (Plan 330 transport operators).
