//! Per-axis 3-tap bump weights over the fractional coordinate (Plan 619 T1.3).
//!
//! DESIGN DECISION (recorded — the plan leaves the kernel shape open at T1.3
//! and pins only its tests: LUT parity ≤ 1e-6, per-axis sum = 1, zero mass
//! outside the support): the 3 taps are the cells
//! `{round(c)−1, round(c), round(c)+1}` around the primary `m = round(c)`,
//! weighted by a **radius-1.5 tent centered at the query** `c = m + δ` —
//! raw weight `max(0, 1 − u/1.5)` at each tap's distance `u ∈ {1+δ, |δ|,
//! 1−δ}` — then normalized to a per-axis partition of unity. Closed form
//! for `δ ∈ [−0.5, 0.5]`, `D = 5 − 2|δ|`:
//!
//! ```text
//! w_prev = (1 − 2δ)/D    w_center = (3 − 2|δ|)/D    w_next = (1 + 2δ)/D
//! ```
//!
//! Properties (each gated below): sums to 1 exactly; direction-sensitive
//! (the nearer side tap outweighs the farther — δ < 0 weights `m−1` more);
//! the far tap decays to 0 exactly at the ±0.5 boundary where the primary
//! itself switches (support is exactly ±1 cell around `m` — no weight ever
//! reaches two cells away); exact hits (δ = 0) read `(0.2, 0.6, 0.2)` — the
//! 3-tap form's deliberate graded-recall dilution, the contrast T1.7's G5
//! measures against Engram's hash cliff. The cos² alternative is T1.8's
//! A/B, not this module's concern.
//!
//! The LUT is the plan's 2⁸ quantization over the signed domain; the hot
//! path is one table read — no division on the hot path (the denominator is
//! folded into the table).
