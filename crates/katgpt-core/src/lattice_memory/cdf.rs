//! Gaussian-CDF occupancy warp — Plan 619 T1.5.
//!
//! E2LSH projections of real (roughly Gaussian) embeddings are NOT uniform
//! per axis: with a fixed width the central cells overload to capacity long
//! before the outer ones, and a uniform Poisson sizing law under-predicts
//! collisions exactly where recall collapses. The fix is design-time (cheaper
//! than the histogram catch): map each projected axis through a **monotone
//! Gaussian CDF** fitted to the corpus's projected mean/spread before
//! quantizing. Monotone ⇒ 1-D locality is preserved (nearby projections map
//! to nearby coordinates, and the fractional part the bump consumes stays
//! real and non-degenerate away from the clamp plateaus); CDF ⇒ post-warp
//! marginals are ≈ uniform ⇒ the Poisson occupancy law the sizer
//! ([`super::sizer`]) solves against actually holds.
//!
//! Numerics: `erf` via Abramowitz–Stegun 7.1.26 (max abs error 1.5e-7) —
//! std-only, zero new deps. `f32::exp` is platform-libm in exactly the way
//! the Box–Muller draws in `address.rs` already are: same-platform
//! determinism is the contract (same-process, same-config ⇒ same lattice —
//! pinned by the tests), and this is not a cross-platform committed-value
//! path.
