//! Deterministic configuration-seeded draws — the shared LSH seed discipline.
//!
//! Moved DOWN from `katgpt-pruners/src/lsh_cache.rs` (Plan 619 substrate duty:
//! the seeded projection + seed logic ships once, here, and `katgpt-pruners`
//! re-exports it — the dep direction pruners → core already exists, so no
//! cycle and never a second copy). The law is katgpt-rs Issue 809 T3: an
//! unseeded draw made the same constructor arguments produce different
//! fingerprints every process, so recorded capture rates were not comparable
//! across runs. Same configuration → same seed → same projection stream.
//!
//! Byte-compatible with the original `lsh_cache::seed_from_config`: FNV-1a
//! over the configuration scalars' little-endian `u64` encodings, in feed
//! order. The only property anyone may rely on: the same configuration yields
//! the same seed. It is NOT a hash for any other purpose.

/// FNV-1a over the configuration scalars' little-endian `u64` bytes, in order.

/// Generalized from the four-scalar `lsh_cache` original: callers feed their
/// own configuration as a slice, the digest discipline is shared.
