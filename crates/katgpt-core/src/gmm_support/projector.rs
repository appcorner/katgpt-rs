//! Johnson–Lindenstrauss projector, revived at E ≥ 32 (Plan 618 T3).
//!
//! # History (Issue 139 — carried so nobody re-shrinks it)
//!
//! The shipped [`JlProjectionMatrix`](crate::shard_embedding::JlProjectionMatrix)
//! (Plan 230) is **deprecated at m=8**: the JL lower bound is violated by
//! over 200× there (1.4–6% NN preservation vs the documented 90% target;
//! Issue 139, 2026-07-16). The projection is SOUND at `E ≥ 256` for the
//! matrix counts this stack uses, and the fit-space law measured at the
//! first consumer (riir-reflex Issue 066 PRE-CHECK: JL k=64 rescues
//! Gaussianity on 253/254 label pools, k-stable across 64/32/16) puts the
//! useful band at **E ≈ 32–64**. This module therefore revives the
//! construction as a const-generic `E ≥ 32` primitive and REFUSES to
//! compile for `E < 32` (a compile-error guard, not a runtime warning —
//! the m=8 mistake was a shape decision, and shape decisions belong in
//! types).
//!
//! # Construction
//!
//! Seeded Rademacher: each matrix entry is `±1/√E` (bit from a SplitMix64
//! stream, row-major). Norm-preserving in expectation:
//! `E[‖Px‖²] = ‖x‖²`.
//!
//! # Packed sign-bit storage (verdict round 2)
//!
//! The `±1/√E` entries are stored as ONE BIT per entry (packed
//! little-endian into `u64` words) and applied with add/sub only — at
//! batch-1 decode the projection is memory-bandwidth-bound and sign bits
//! make its weight reads near-free (E·D/8 bytes vs E·D·4), the natural
//! fit for the ternary/Bonsai direction. The `1/√E` scale is applied
//! once per output row.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Same `(D, E, seed)` → identical packed words → identical BLAKE3
//! commitment → bit-identical projections (pure add/sub/mul, no libm on
//! the apply path — the scale is computed once at construction with one
//! `sqrt`, an exactly-rounded IEEE op).
