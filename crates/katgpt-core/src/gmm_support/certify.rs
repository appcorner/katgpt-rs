//! Offline excess/deficit certification for support gates (Plan 618
//! T6/T7 — the Research 604 App-E restatement).
//!
//! The paper's continuous bound (`vol(excess) ≤ ‖P̂−P‖₁/τ`) uses Lebesgue
//! volume, which is UNMEASURABLE under unbounded Gaussians in 256-D —
//! the stack's implementable form (verdict round 1):
//!
//! - **excess** = Φ_neg-weighted excess MASS: sample the reference GMM,
//!   measure the gate's open rate (the volume the reference actually
//!   visits — the only volume a serving consumer ever sees).
//! - **deficit** = open rate on HELD-OUT in-support data (closed-on-your-
//!   own-support is the failure the training objective fixes).
//! - **bound check (T7)** = on fixtures with KNOWN P, the L1 distance
//!   `‖P̂−P‖₁ = E_P[|p̂/p − 1|]` is Monte-Carlo estimable in closed form
//!   (both densities evaluable) — excess is compared against it with a
//!   consumer-pinned slack, at the fixed-threshold ratio form where the
//!   threshold τ = 1. Fixture-scoped sanity, NOT a tight bound.
//!
//! # The leak-by-construction canary (T6, the §3.6 discipline)
//!
//! A validator that cannot red is not a validator. The control arm is a
//! LINEAR DISCRIMINATOR gate fit on the same features — the class the
//! paper's D1 ablation refutes (discriminative gates open arbitrarily
//! outside training data) — and the extrapolation probes are planted FAR
//! OUT along its positive normal, where it is GUARANTEED to fire. If the
//! canary discriminator does NOT fire on those probes, the INSTRUMENT
//! itself is broken and [`canary_fire_rate`] returns
//! [`CertifyError::CanaryDidNotFire`] (the exit-2 class) — never a
//! confident green.
