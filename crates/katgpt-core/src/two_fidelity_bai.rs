//! Two-Fidelity Certified Best-Action Identification (2FFS) — Plan 615.
//!
//! Certified two-fidelity best-action identification for stochastic minimax
//! trees, distilled from Chen & Chen, *Two-Fidelity Best-Action
//! Identification for Stochastic Minimax Tree* (arXiv:2606.01708, NeurIPS
//! 2026) — Research 601. Every node can be evaluated by a **fast oracle**
//!       (cheap, deterministic, biased within a known nondecreasing envelope
//!       `B(h)`, `B(0) = 0`) or a **slow oracle** (expensive, stochastic,
//!       unbiased, queryable at any exposed node). The algorithm races minimax-style
//!       fast expansion against MCTS-style slow certification until the root action
//!       is certified ε-optimal with confidence 1−δ.
//!
//! This module ships the Phase-1 search (plan T1.1–T1.7): the [`MinimaxSpace`]
//! consumer trait, the per-node interval state with minimax backup (paper
//! Eqs. 4/6, Lemmas 2.3/B.2), the time-uniform sub-Gaussian radius [`beta`],
//! the confidence allocation, the result type, and the root
//! leader/challenger loop with per-(node, side, scale) resolution (plan
//! T1.5/T1.6): [`two_fidelity_search`] races the local slow-sample route
//! against the budgeted recursive route (Eq. 7) under latched `Done_s(v,k)`
//! bitflags, with deterministic tie-breaks, the empty-intersection guard
//! (paper B.3 convention: terminate + default action, never loop), and the
//! ρ₀ = 0 early exit.
//!
//! Pure query-allocation + interval bookkeeping — zero gradient descent, zero
//! weights, zero deps beyond `arrayvec`. Opt-in feature `two_fidelity_bai`;
//! never promoted to default (the default search slot keeps `mcts_search`;
//! this fills the empty *certified-search* slot).
