//! Two-Fidelity Certified BAI (2FFS) — GOAT gate bench (Plan 615 Phase 2).
//!
//! Exercises T2.1–T2.5 against the paper's own fixture family (balanced b-ary
//! stochastic minimax trees, adversarial fast bias) on the unified cost model
//! `cost = n_fast + c·n_slow` (c fixed per setting; ops reported separately —
//! the 2FFS module does not expose an ops counter, so the paper's 1.9–4.6×
//! ops figures stay context rows).
//!
//! # Gates
//!
//! - **CANARY (first, impossible floors fire)** — the gate helper must panic
//!   when its floor is impossible (proven via `catch_unwind`), the
//!   Clopper–Pearson machinery must reproduce the E=0 closed form
//!   `1 − 0.05^(1/N)`, and the counting allocator must move on a known
//!   allocation. If any of these fail, every later gate is unmeasured.
//! - **SANITY (T2.2b)** — the negamax-UCT adapter on a small zero-noise tree
//!   (D=3, b=3) must converge to the exact minimax value as its budget grows;
//!   a weak adapter would inflate the G2 win. Pinned BEFORE any comparison row.
//! - **G1 (empirical PAC)** — 2FFS error = strict `V*(pick) < best − ε` over
//!   the seeded suite (paper §4 parity: 100 trees/setting, (D,b) ∈
//!   {(5,8),(7,6),(10,3)}), judged by a ONE-SIDED CLOPPER–PEARSON 95% UPPER
//!   bound on the error probability vs δ = 0.05 (a zero-error run reads as
//!   consistent-with-δ, never pass-by-fiat). Every result must terminate
//!   certified, and every certified root interval must contain the true value
//!   (Thm 3.1's certificate body). The T1.3 beta-coverage and T1.8 property
//!   arms (Lemma 2.3 / B.2 / B.5) stand in the module's own tests — landed.
//! - **G2 (strict paired win, LB95 > 0 per setting on the unified cost
//!   model)** — against (a) **BAI-MCTS** (LUCB-style fixed-confidence
//!   stopping, Kaufmann–Koolen 2017 class: leader/challenger interval stop at
//!   the same (ε, δ), targeted descents, negamax backups, cap = stopping
//!   failure) and (b) a **negamax-UCT adapter** (plain UCT, budget-exact,
//!   checkpoints 4096·2^j): UCT's comparison budget B* is the SMALLEST
//!   checkpoint whose suite error ≤ 2FFS's (matched accuracy, favoring UCT);
//!   if no checkpoint matches within the cap, B* = cap+1 — understating
//!   UCT's true cost, conservative for the win claim. Paired LB95 =
//!   mean − 1.645·SE over per-tree cost differences (Bench 905 protocol).
//! - **G3** — landing discipline: the mcts.rs / chance_puct.rs surfaces are
//!   untouched by this bench (verified at commit time via `git show --stat`).
//!   `mcts_search` itself is single-player UCT (fixed player_id, max-only
//!   backups): it estimates MAX-MAX values on these minimax trees and is NOT
//!   a valid adversarial baseline (verdict round 1) — it appears in the
//!   record as a labelled context row only, never executed here.
//! - **G4 (alloc)** — `two_fidelity_search` on a small tree allocates a
//!   constant setup per search (the `HashMap::with_capacity(1024)` node table
//!   + the result `Vec`), and NOTHING per iteration: allocs(3 searches) ==
//!     3 × allocs(1 search) and allocs(1 search) ≤ 4 (counting allocator,
//!     chance_puct G4 precedent, after a warmup search).
//!
//! # Context rows (not gates)
//!
//! - fast-only minimax (fold of fast oracle values) — the paper's 0.88–0.91
//!   accuracy class; cost = full fold (conservative for the baseline).
//! - fixed-depth slow-only (level-2 frontier sampled to ε/2 Hoeffding widths)
//!   — cheap and badly truncated at depth.
//! - paper-measured parity figures (samples 163×/988×/1458×, ops 2.84×/4.58×/
//!   1.86× vs BAI-MCTS) are CONTEXT rows in the record — our measured numbers
//!   on the unified cost model are the claim.
//!
//! # Honest divergences (documented, never papered over)
//!
//! - BAI-MCTS is the LUCB-stopping flavour of the Kaufmann–Koolen class (the
//!   plan names "UGapE-MCTS / LUCB-MCTS"); node estimates are the standard
//!   sign-alternated averaging backups — the estimator bias vs true max-min
//!   values is the known baseline weakness the two-fidelity paper exploits.
//! - Baseline per-node state is a flat `Vec<(n, mean)>` sized to the fixture
//!   (bench-only storage choice; does not touch the module).
//! - Cap hits are stopping failures and are REPORTED per setting (the paper's
//!   "slow-only often fails to stop" class); capped rows enter the pairing
//!   with cost = cap, which UNDERSTATES the baseline cost — conservative.
//!
//! # Run
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p katgpt-core --features two_fidelity_bai \
//!   --bench bench_615_two_fidelity_bai_goat --release -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `B615_TREES=<n>` shrinks the suite for a dev shakedown; the shipped
//! protocol default (and the bench record) is 100 trees/setting.
