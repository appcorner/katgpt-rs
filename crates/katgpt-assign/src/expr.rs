//! The expression DAG — the algorithmic heart (Research 607 §1).
//!
//! Nodes: `Lookup` leaves (one per referenced `(dimension, container)`
//! utilization, SHARED across specs; one per object for the moved flag) +
//! `Sum` / `Max` internal nodes + `Affine` (`k*x + c`, exact i64) +
//! `Const`. Every node caches its current `i64` value. The leaf-affectance
//! view: a candidate move touches a handful of leaves; recompute runs
//! bottom-up over REACHED nodes only (delta evaluation).
//!
//! Exactness note (why no segment tree): Meta's production solver needs a
//! segment tree for incremental `Sum` because FLOAT accumulation drifts
//! (1e-3-epsilon per apply × 1e4 moves). Integer sums are exact by
//! construction — a plain recompose-over-changed-children is bit-identical
//! to a full recompute (asserted by the delta-property test), so the
//! simpler mechanism is the correct one here.
//!
//! `Max` children are recomputed by scan. The paper's value-sorted child
//! list (O(changed) updates) pays off at 1e5-scale child counts; Phase 1
//! target sizes (containers ≤ ~10⁴ ⇒ child counts ≤ ~10⁴) sit inside the
//! regime where the branch-free scan is simpler and fast enough — noted
//! as the Phase 2 optimization if a consumer needs it.
