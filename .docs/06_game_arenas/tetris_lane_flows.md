# Tetris arena lanes — how each lane picks a spot (the site figures)

> **Purpose:** the source of truth for the "How each lane decides" figures on
> [reflex.gist.rs/arena](https://reflex.gist.rs/arena/). Each `gfflow` block
> below renders ONE figure (named by its `file` key) as the family swimlane +
> the 390 px card list + the step-through walk; the renderer is
> `reflex-site/scripts/render_flows.py`, which writes the outputs beside this
> doc AND into `reflex-site/assets/` (the mirror law — re-render from here,
> never hand-edit an SVG). Labels stay short: the figures must read at page
> scale; the numbers live in the records cited under each block.
>
> The walks' IN/OUT payloads are derived by
> `reflex-site/scripts/build_arena_flow_walks.py` from the arena's RECORDED
> games (`reflex-site/arena/demo_oracle.json`) — captured, never typed (the
> family numbers law applied to payloads).

Every lane plays the same game: a seeded 7-bag, a real hard drop from the
top (`laya-tetris-v3`), guideline scoring. They differ only in HOW a
landing spot is chosen.

**Numbering note (Plan 620, the branch rule — design guide §8.2).** Numbers
follow the PATH. The raw lane is the one flow with a fork: the engine's
verdict branches, so its two alternatives share 3 — **3a** *in corpus* →
play the highest, **3b** *off corpus* → abstain, and the abstain plays a
labelled random spot. The rulebook's last step loops back to 1 (the search
restarts every piece — a back edge, never a number); the modes figure is a
cycle of back edges: BUILD branches to **2a** DOWNSTACK (3+ covered holes)
and **2b** SURVIVE (a 12+ row stack), and both hand back to BUILD. Every
step is `live`: all five lanes are real, recorded and measured.

## 1 · laya (Rust) and laya (Python) — the model reads every spot

Both lanes run the same open weights; Rust is the served port, Python the
torch reference it is measured against. The figure's lanes are the
pipeline's phases: the game deals a position, the harness enumerates the
spots and writes the sentence, the model answers.

[[walk]]
title = "List every spot"
text  = "The harness enumerates every legal landing: each rotation of the piece in each column, hard-dropped. For the opening O piece that is nine distinct futures — the count rides the recorded turn above."

```

Cost: one model forward per spot (~0.1–0.7 s each on an M3); it sees one
piece — no preview, no plan. Records: katgpt-rs `.benchmarks/892_laya_h2h.md`.

## 2 · KatGPT modelless — laya's answers, distilled into a µs head

```gfflow
file  = "tetris_flow_modelless.svg"
title = "Reflex · modelless: laya's answers distilled into a µs head"
accent = "reflex"
intro = "Press play to walk the same recorded turn through the distillation: the same sentence in, a different pick out — in microseconds."

status = "live"

[[edge]]

[[edge]]
from = "decode"; to = "head"
[[edge]]
from = "head"; to = "play"

[[walk]]
title = "The same sentence"
text  = "The distillation changes nothing about the input: the very same recorded opening turn the laya lane reads. That is the point — same question, a different (much cheaper) answerer."
steps = ["sentence"]
in    = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_modelless/01_in.json", label = "the same recorded opening turn" }
[[walk]]
title = "Decode to features"
text  = "The sentence is decoded back into the board features it came from: holes left, how flat the surface sits, stack height, which side it lands on, lines cleared. A handful of numbers — no words reach the head."
steps = ["decode"]
[[walk]]
title = "A tiny linear head"
text  = "A small linear head, fitted offline on laya's recorded answers, scores the features. It imitates laya — 44 of 120 picks agree on the pinned corpus — so it plays like laya, only about a hundred-thousand times faster."
steps = ["head"]
out   = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_modelless/01_out.json", label = "the head's answer to the same turn" }
[[walk]]

steps = ["play"]
out   = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_modelless/01_out.json", label = "the played spot" }
```

It imitates laya (44/120 agreement on the pinned corpus), so it plays like
laya — only ~10⁵× faster. Records: riir-reflex game heads, Plan 607.

## 3 · raw baseline — the engine with its heads removed

The one flow with a **branch**: the engine's verdict forks at step 3.

```gfflow
file  = "tetris_flow_raw.svg"
title = "raw baseline: the engine with its heads removed — the honest floor"
accent = "reflex"

[[walk]]
title = "Corpus engine"
text  = "With no heads, the engine can only compare the sentence against its corpus. The spot sentences of a real game are almost all new — so this branch is the one the recorded raw game took, five hundred and fifteen times in a row."
steps = ["engine"]
[[walk]]
title = "In corpus → play the highest"
text  = "When a sentence lands close to something the corpus holds, the engine answers like laya would and the highest-probability neighbour wins. In the whole recorded raw game this path never fired — that honesty is what makes it the floor."
steps = ["play"]
[[walk]]
title = "Off corpus → abstain, play random"
text  = "Every outcome comes back null — the engine abstains rather than guess. The abstain plays a random legal spot from a separate seeded stream, labelled as random in the replay so nothing pretends to be a decision."
steps = ["abstain"]
out   = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_raw/01_out.json", label = "every P(clean) null · a recorded random pick" }
```

The honest floor every other lane is measured against.

## 4 · Reflexer (the rulebook search) — plan three pieces ahead

The Issue 892 hybrid champion (genome `68cae9d382014662`): no model, no
sentence — it searches placements and scores the boards with a strategy
rulebook.

```gfflow
file  = "tetris_flow_rulebook.svg"
title = "Reflex · rulebook: plan three pieces ahead, play one move"
accent = "reflex"
intro = "Press play to walk the search over one recorded position — the real seed-607 turn that ends in the recorded tetris. The board beside each step replays that exact position."

[[edge]]
from = "play"; to = "fall"; back = true; label = "next piece"

[[walk]]
title = "Look ahead — the falling piece"

[[walk]]
title = "Chain the preview piece"
text  = "Each candidate board is paired with every landing spot of the preview piece — and the tree is pruned hard: only the best six boards survive each level, so the search stays tiny instead of exploding."
steps = ["preview"]
[[walk]]
title = "Cover the unknown third piece"
text  = "The piece after that is not known yet. Rather than gamble on a single guess, the plan plays out every piece the bag could still deal — the search branches over all of them."
steps = ["bag"]
[[walk]]
title = "Score every end board"
text  = "Each final board is scored by the strategy rulebook — holes, bumpiness, stack height, wells, lines cleared — the instincts of a careful human player, written as numbers."
steps = ["score"]
[[walk]]
title = "Average over the unknown · pick the plan"
text  = "A plan is only as good as its worst realistic draw: scores are averaged across the possible third pieces, so a line-clear that needs the I-piece rates low — it usually does not come. The sturdiest plan wins."

[[walk]]
title = "Play the first move — then re-plan"

out   = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_rulebook/02_out.json", label = "the recorded tetris landing" }
```

"Average over the unknown piece" is the point: a plan that only works if
the I-piece comes scores low, because it usually does not come.

## 5 · the rulebook's modes — play for tetrises only while it is safe

A cycle of back edges: BUILD branches into trouble, trouble hands back.

```gfflow

[[walk]]
title = "BUILD — the default mode"
text  = "On a clean, low stack it builds a 9-1 stack: nine columns packed flat plus one open well on the right edge, saving I-pieces to clear four lines at once. The 9-1 shape was self-evolved — nobody hand-coded it; it fell out of the training climb."
steps = ["bu"]
in    = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_modes/01_in.json", label = "a real recorded build position" }
[[walk]]
title = "Trouble #1 — covered holes → DOWNSTACK"
text  = "Three or more holes buried under the stack and building stops paying: every new piece makes it worse. The mode flips to DOWNSTACK, which deliberately clears the lines sitting above the holes to dig them back out."

[[walk]]

out   = { lang = "json", src = "data/flows/tetris_modes/03_out.json", label = "the measured height vs the genome's threshold" }
[[walk]]
title = "Recovery — both modes hand back to BUILD"
text  = "Holes dug out, or the stack back under twelve — either way the mode returns to BUILD and the cycle starts over. The board is re-read before every single piece, so the switch is never late."
steps = ["bu"]

[[walk]]

steps = ["bu", "ds", "sv"]
```

Build uses the self-evolved score weights (the 9-1 stack emerged from the
climb — nobody hand-coded it); Downstack and Survive use the proven
survival weights. The mode is re-read from the board before every piece
(Survive wins when both fire). Records: katgpt-rs `.benchmarks/892_tetris_rulebook_arena.md`.
