//! LoopCD recurrent-depth contrast guidance (Plan 617, arXiv:2610.02185).
//!
//! The probe_guidance combine family (Issue 865) with its weak side
//! re-sourced to a **completed loop iteration `k`** of the weight-shared
//! looped forward — modelless, zero training, aligned by construction (same
//! block, same head, same prefix; only compute differs):
//!
//! ```text
//! logit mode:   z_k = head(h_k)             # one extra scratch head pass
//!               z′  = z_R + ω·(z_R − z_k)   # = affine_combine(z_R, z_k, 1+ω)
//! hidden mode:  h′  = h_R + ω·(h_R − h_k)   # blended BEFORE head; ONE head pass
//! adaptive:     ω   = ω_max·[1 − (p₁ − p₂)] # top-two softmax margin of z_R
//! ```
//!
//! # Deviations pinned here (verdict-review honesty)
//!
//! - **Hidden-mode adaptive ω consumes the PREVIOUS decode step's margin.**
//!   The Eq-4 gate is computed in-step from `softmax(z_R)` in logit mode
//!   (z_R exists pre-guidance). Hidden mode's one-head-pass law means h_R is
//!   never read out, so the margin comes from the decoder's last actual
//!   output distribution (carried in [`LoopGuidance::last_margin`]; the
//!   decoder's current belief — settled tokens stay settled, guidance
//!   sharpens, margin grows, ω → 0). First call falls back to the fixed
//!   `config.omega`. A pinned unit test keeps this honest.
//! - **ω = 0 posture is a structural no-op** (no capture pass, no combine,
//!   no margin carry) — cheaper than "armed but identity", and
//!   bit-identical by construction rather than by f32 identity argument.
//!
//! # Precedence vs the exit family (Plan 617 T1.3)
//!
//! `AdvantageMarginGate` / `GainCostLoopHalter` / `LoopResidualExit` operate
//! on UNGUIDED per-iteration readouts and decide whether to keep looping.
//! Guidance transforms whichever prediction is FINALLY decoded (exit-
//! iteration or loop-R): the exits never see guided logits, the final decode
//! always does. The two mechanisms compose; neither subsumes the other.
//!
//! # Zero-alloc (T1.5)
//!
//! Scratch is pre-sized at [`LoopGuidance::new`] and only `resize`d (a
//! no-op at matching capacity) inside the forward — steady-state decode
//! allocates zero bytes with guidance armed (pinned by the counting-
//! allocator gate test).
//!
//! # Reference-capture contract
//!
//! `h_k` is captured at the END of loop iteration `ref_loop` (1-based) —
//! the completed-iteration state, post residual-gate. If the loop exits
//! (any halter/gate fires) BEFORE `ref_loop` completes, no reference exists
//! and guidance is a no-op for that step (documented; `ref_loop = 1` with
//! the default exits cannot happen — every exit family runs at `tau ≥ 1`
//! i.e. after iteration 1 completes, which is exactly the default capture
//! point). `ref_loop ≥ loop_count + 1` never captures → permanent no-op;
//! `validate()` warns via refusal only for the structurally-invalid 0.
