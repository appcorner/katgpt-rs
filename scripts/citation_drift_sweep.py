"""Run the citation verdict over EVERY contract repo, not just this one.

`scripts/issue_citation_gate.py` (Issue 749) is katgpt-rs-scoped by
construction: `docs_gate.yml` has a single checkout, so it could never see a
sibling. That is the right shape for a per-push CI gate and the wrong shape
for this defect class, which is *especially* not repo-local — a citation's
whole problem is that its referent lives somewhere else. This is the sixth
instance of the shape (Issue 702 `ci_gate_coverage`, 725 `numbering`,
`required_features`, `percentile`, `trap_sentinel`), and like the first two it
found real rows the moment it was pointed anywhere but here.

    this script                 workstation, on demand, every contract repo
    issue_citation_gate.py      CI, per-push (docs_gate.sh), katgpt-rs only

⛔ REPORT, exit 0-on-clean / 1-on-drift / 2-on-untrustworthy — NOT a per-push
gate, for the same reason as every other sweep in the family: CI's single
checkout would derive an EMPTY population and print a confident green over
zero repos.

Measured (Issue 752, 2026-09-12), over 19 contract repos / 2,948 citations
in 35 documents — a dated SNAPSHOT, not a checksum: five-plus concurrent
sessions edit these documents, and the walk moved by 3 between this repair's
first run and its last:

    291 CROSS over 164 per-repo adjudications · 54 IN-LOCAL-RANGE ·
    0 ORPHAN · 908 AMBIGUOUS
    (of the 291: 7 ⛔MISATTRIBUTED, 22 ⛔MISLEADING crate hints)

**291 counts EDITS; 164 counts DECISIONS, and sizing the work from the first
is wrong by up to 4.2x.** Inserting a repo name is mechanical; deciding WHICH
owner a sentence means — most of these numbers are owned by several repos at
once — is paid once per number, not once per occurrence. riir-viewbridge's 17
rows are FOUR decisions (`Plan 532` alone recurs nine times); riir-auth's 8
are three; riir-chain's 4 are four. Reported per repo as `cross=N over M num`,
with the same standing as tail support in the percentile audit: it ORDERS the
work and is never a second verdict.

The workspace total is a SUM of the per-repo counts, never a union — riir-auth
and riir-game-sdk both citing `Plan 488` is two adjudications in two
documents, and unioning them reported 142 where the work is 164.

⛔ **TWO error rates over TWO populations — they are never blended**, because
a SAMPLE rate does not transfer to rows it never sampled:

    254 rows (the pre-752 corpus)   7/43 = 16%, a stratified SAMPLE read
                                    line-by-line across 13 repos (751 T1)
    +45 rows (owner-consistency)    1/45, a full CENSUS — every row read (752),
                                    with ONE row refuted afterwards by a
                                    measurement the census could not make (754)

The predecessor figure — 308 — was quoted with no error rate at all and was
contaminated by an alias class worth ~50% of its first four rows (749's
addendum). A classifier's bucket boundaries ARE the finding, so the FP classes
are written down here rather than silently healed:

    alias/abbreviation NOT in the alias table   ("ndb" = riir-neuron-db,
                                                 "mmorpg" = riir-mmorpg-examples)

                                                 the foreign number)
    a local number one above the local max      (riir-ai cites its own Plan 590
                                                 with `.plans` topping out at 588)

and the class that ran the OTHER way — 45 rows the rule ABSORBED
--------------------------------------------------------------
Every FP class above inflates the count. Issue 752 measured the deflating one,
and nobody had looked: qualification asked **"is a repo named?"** and never
**"does that repo own the number?"**. Of 368 citations the rule certified, **45
named no owner at all** — 37 where the 3-line window merely contained a sibling
name (a crate-inventory table row, an adjacent clause) and 8 carrying an
explicit attribution to a repo that does not have the number. `riir-chain Plan
211` where riir-chain's `.plans` top out at 058; `katgpt-rs Issue 513` where
513 is riir-train's and katgpt-rs owns only the script the line is about — the
attribution followed the CODE while the number followed the DOCUMENT.

⛔ The census's THIRD example was WRONG, and it is kept here because the way it
was wrong is the lesson. `riir-mmorpg-examples Issue 059` was filed as an
outright wrong address "where that repo allocated 058 and 061 and never 059".
That repo DID allocate 059 — its own HISTORY.md carries `## Issue 059
(2026-08-14) — Demonstration-teachable pets`, resolved and removed the day it
was filed, and removed WITHOUT an intervening commit, so neither the worktree
walk nor `git log` could see it (Issue 754, `heading_allocated()`). The census
read every row and still could not have caught this: the instrument it checked
each row against was itself blind, so a full census inherits its ORACLE's blind
spots at 100%. `0/45` was a statement about the reader, never about the rule.

That is a **~15% under-count**, the same magnitude as the 16% over-count and
in the opposite direction. It is the T2(a) argument below applied to the path
it was never applied to: crate hints were counted as findings *because* a
plausible address that is wrong beats no address, and the directory-name path
— which silently absolves where the crate path merely annotates — was exempted
from that argument with no measurement behind the exemption.

The repair also tightened the name match to segment boundaries: a plain
`"mmorpg-remake" in ctx` read riir-viewbridge's `mmorpg-remake-unity` as naming
**mmorpg-remake** and qualified a `Plan 031` citation on a different repo's name.

Two adjudications the per-repo filings forced, recorded so they stay decided
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
**`ndb` is NOT a missing alias — it is a real finding.** riir-auth writes "ndb
Plan 327/328" and riir-neuron-db owns both, so the row looks like a false
positive of the alias table. It is not, and the alias table must NOT grow a
hand-typed entry for it. The alias is DERIVED (directory name minus `riir-`),
deliberately, because a hand-maintained list drifts exactly as a hand-typed
repo set does; and more decisively, AGENTS.md is *the contract a new agent
reads*, and a new agent does not know that `ndb` means riir-neuron-db. An
address only its author can follow is the thing this sweep exists to find.

**A truncated read produced a wrong filed count.** riir-viewbridge's issue was
filed at 12 rows when the true count was 13: the per-repo print caps CROSS at
12, and the issue's author counted the printed ROWS instead of reading
`cross=N` in the header. `--full` exists because of this, and the truncation
notice now names the flag — but the durable lesson is that the header is the
count and the row list is a sample of it.

Why the window stays BACKWARD-ONLY — measured, not assumed
----------------------------------------------------------
Owner-consistency made the forward-window question answerable for the first
time, because it strips the noise: ask not "is a repo named below?" but "is an
OWNER of this number named below?". Measured over the CROSS set, **15 rows**
qualify within 1-2 lines forward. Read line by line, **at most 3 are genuine
attributions** — riir-game-sdk's `Issue 458 … See riir-ai/AGENTS.md` is the
clearest. The other twelve are incidental: a dep-path note two lines down
(`../katgpt-rs/crates/katgpt-core`), a `Batch 47 …` list, a "three commits
across repos" enumeration where the named repo is one commit host and not the
plan's owner, and — twice — a forward line attributing a **different** number
(`See .issues/529 (riir-ai)` sitting under a citation of 496 and 528).

So widening forward buys ~3 false-positive repairs and costs ~12 newly
SUPPRESSED true findings. That is the wrong direction by this module's own
governing lesson: a suppressed row is invisible to the sample that produced
the 16% figure, while an emitted false positive is merely read and dismissed.
Backward-only stays.

Three buckets, and the split is the whole point of re-measuring
---------------------------------------------------------------
**CROSS** — the finding. Not local, no repo named, and a sibling DOES own the
number: this is the rebinding hazard (749's founding example).

**IN-LOCAL-RANGE** — UNDECIDED, reported separately, never folded into CROSS.
The number is at or below the repo's OWN top allocation for that kind, so a
locally-intended referent is plausible even though no file carries it: a
number the repo skipped, or filed and never committed. riir-chain's HISTORY
narrating its own work as "Closed as a class (Issue 039, same day)" is
exactly this — riir-chain allocated 1-38 and 41-46, never 39, and six
siblings have one. Calling that a cross-repo citation is a misattribution,
and it was 46 of the 300 rows the first pass reported.

**ORPHAN** — not local, not in local range, and NO repo in the workspace owns
it. Measured 0; kept as its own bucket because it is a different repair
(the number is wrong, or its repo left the contract) from CROSS.

**AMBIGUOUS** is the gate's stated blind spot, carried over verbatim: a number
that exists BOTH locally and in a sibling is undecidable from the number
alone, so it is REPORTED and deliberately NOT gated (a ceiling would red
whenever somebody writes a perfectly correct citation to a new local number a
sibling also happens to have — `staged_set_audit.py`'s rationale one axis over).

The two-lane GAP (Issue 921 Arm B) — preventive, membership-shaped
------------------------------------------------------------------
A repo whose kind dir carries `.highwater_local` (riir-infer `.issues` 035,
riir-rethink 23) DECLARES — machine-readably, per its AGENTS.md numbering
section — that the local lane tops at that counter and the range above it is
inherited-only. For such a repo the GAP is `counter < n < floor`, where floor
is the smallest git-log FILE ADD above the counter (`--diff-filter=A`, full
history — the same record source `file_and_history_allocated` reads; NOT the
worktree walk, and NOT the heading oracle, whose additions are
order-dependent and must never shrink the gap). Citations inside the gap are
NOT local-intent: they classify CROSS/ORPHAN — actionable, with the
mechanical repeat repair — instead of collecting forever as UNDECIDED
IN-LOCAL-RANGE behind a breached ceiling (the measured founding row:
riir-infer's bare `Issue 980`, which sat at n=980 <= top 1004 with no local
record anywhere). Repos without the file derive an empty gap and
byte-identical behavior. The derived floor prints on the per-repo line;
`.highwater_local` rides both advisory patterns (a dirty or upstream-moved
counter can move verdicts, so it is IN this sweep's population and
discloses). `--prove-fires` replays the founding specimen two-sided at
riir-infer `f0191e3^` (the bare 980 must classify CROSS -> riir-ai, gap
35..998) vs `f0191e3` (the repaired row must find nothing): a local CLONE,
not an archive extraction, because the floor leg is a git-log leg and an
extraction has no history — it would derive the tree's smallest add (1003)
and under-test the very derivation the arm exists to pin.

Two audited sub-questions (Issue 751 T2) — both decided with evidence
--------------------------------------------------------------------
**A crate name is NOT a qualification form.** The workspace's crate->repo map
is unique (156 package names, ZERO collisions across 19 repos), so
`riir-games-mmorpg::…` *could* address riir-ai mechanically — but the map
lives in no document the reader has, and the measurement refutes the weaker
claim too: of the 45 CROSS rows carrying a crate name in the window, **4
resolve to a repo that does NOT own the cited number** (riir-game-sdk's
`Issue 097` sits next to `riir-games-mmorpg::sync_facades::avatar_sync` while
097 belongs to riir-mmorpg-examples/riir-chain/mmorpg-editor). Accepting
crate names as qualifiers would certify those four as clean, and they are the
worst rows in the corpus — a plausible address that is wrong. So the rows are
counted as findings and sub-labelled `crate-hint` / `⛔MISLEADING` to ORDER
the repair, never to excuse it.

**Zero-padding is the SAME allocator namespace.** `Issue 006` and `Issue 6`
are one number: both sides already `int()` (the citation regex `\\d{2,4}`, and
`allocated()`'s `^(\\d+)_`). Measured: 5,839 allocated file names, 5,758
3-digit + 81 2-digit, and the 78 numbers carrying BOTH widths are
width-normalisation RENAMES of one document (`.research/07_Screening_…` ->
`.research/007_Screening_…`, same title). Corpus usage is genuinely mixed —
**1,713 padded vs 1,221 unpadded citations** — so treating the forms as
distinct namespaces would misread 58% of it. The width bound `\\d{2,4}` is
**load-bearing, not a blind spot awaiting repair** (Issue 753): re-measured over
every tracked `.md` in the workspace, widening to `\\d{1,4}` would manufacture
**51 false heads** — `## Bench 1: Throughput` is a section NUMBER, not a
citation of `.benchmarks/001_*` — and **0** true ones. The list expander's
PLURAL precondition is the other half and neither may be costed alone: it is
what keeps `Plan 460, 31.5%` and `Issue 096, 2,294 LOC` from ever being read as
a second citation. What the class needed was liveness, not width — the
complement is counted every run and pinned at 0 (`max_single_digit`), because
"0 occurrences" was a dated measurement over documents five-plus sessions edit
daily.

Two floors, not one
-------------------
`max_cross` is green over whatever the instrument can SEE. A regex regression
takes the citation walk to 0 and every ceiling passes, indistinguishable from
clean prose — `min_citations` catches that per repo. It cannot do the job
alone: the finding classes are all decided against the DERIVED repo
population, and a population that collapses to 1 makes every citation read as
local-or-orphan. `min_repos` is that second floor, and it is the same
quantity `issue_citation_floors.txt` owns, so it is ASSERTED equal, not
trusted (the `trap_sentinel_drift_sweep` vs `trap_sentinel_gate` precedent).
`documents` is NOT restated at all — it is read straight out of the gate's
pins, because a quantity with one home cannot drift.

⛔ The corpus MOVES under the sweep. Five-plus agent sessions edit these
documents concurrently; riir-mmorpg-examples' HISTORY.md gained 46 lines
between two runs an hour apart during T1. Ceilings are therefore a RATCHET at
the measured value (numbering_drift_sweep's stance, not trap_sentinel's wall):
a new unqualified citation reds immediately, and the standing backlog is
visible in the pins rather than silently tolerated. Re-pin DELIBERATELY, in
the commit that changes it.

    reading `seal-game-editor Plan 226` — correct, and the qualified form this

    Two ways an oracle stops being credible, and they are NOT the same fact:

    * it is BEHIND its upstream on commits touching a numbered directory — the
      allocation may be sitting in those commits;
    * it reports up to date, but from a remote-tracking ref nobody has
      refreshed (Issue 827 T5). `(0, 0)` means "as of the last fetch", and
      before the fetch that exposed it seal-game-editor read exactly `0 behind`
