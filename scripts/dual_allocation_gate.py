"""Issue 796 — the allocation-time dual-allocation gate, CLASSIFIED.

Issue 791 T3 deferred a gate that reds when this checkout and its upstream
have both allocated document numbers since their merge base, on the unmeasured
fear: "a long-lived branch legitimately allocates ahead of its remote".
Issue 796 measured that fear MOOT (7202 one-sided pairs workspace-wide, all
green BY CONSTRUCTION — the intersection is empty whenever only one side
allocated) and measured the gate's real hazard instead: of 39 distinct
workspace divergence incidents, 31 were TWINs — the same document carried on
two post-rebase lines of history, where a naive hard gate cries wolf and the
remedy is one fetch.

So the verdict is CLASSIFIED, structurally, by filename stem per colliding
number:

    TWIN        same stem added on both sides since the merge base — your own
                rebased/cherry-picked line still sitting in the stale
                remote-tracking ref. Annotated, exit-neutral: `git fetch`
                resolves it; failing the run on it would train people to
                ignore the gate.
    INDEPENDENT different stems, same number — two distinct documents are
                about to own one number. RED, exit 1, both sides' adding
                commits named. This is the 791/780/935 class, caught while
                both sides are still diverging — one `git fetch` + a renumber
                now, instead of a citation-drift archaeology later.

One numbered document per repo view: the gate reads THIS checkout's tips
(HEAD and its upstream), not history — the historical replay is the probe's
job (`dual_allocation_fp_probe.py`). Reach limit, measured in 796: the gate
catches the divergences the running box participates in; a box-vs-box
collision on the wire is invisible here until a fetch brings it in, and the
merge-time wall (numbering_gate + 795) owns what lands despite that.

    scripts/dual_allocation_gate.py [repo]        # verdict (default: this repo)
    scripts/dual_allocation_gate.py --prove-fires # the two-session collision
                                                  # fixture, both verdicts

Exit codes: 0 = clean or TWIN-only; 1 = INDEPENDENT collision; 2 = blind
(no upstream / no reflog / self-test failure) — a gate that cannot see must
refuse, never print a green zero.

    cannot reach the consumer (Issue 775's sentence, Issue 789's rule).

    `arm_reach_audit` measured the consequence: **0 killed of 55**, the whole
    module UNREACHED — `classify`, `added_stems`, `adding_commits` and
    `upstream_of_head` were asserted by nothing, in a gate that runs on every
    push. The fixture arms that DO reach them already existed as
    `prove_fires()`, behind `--prove-fires`, and `arm_reach` deliberately never
    invokes that name.

    ⚠ `prove_fires` is excluded from `RUN_ARMS` for a COST reason that does not
    apply here: the exclusion was measured against known-answer arms that
    `git archive` a frozen tree (80.2s vs 4.4s, 436 git invocations). This one
    builds two small temp repos and runs in **1.45s**, against the docs gate's
    ~24s wall — cheaper than the `platform_dead_code_floor_gate` check already
    in the set. Calling it here costs that once per push and buys the module its
    only reach. Its body stays unmutated either way, because the name is still
    in `ARM_NAMES`.
