# Plan 618: `gmm_support` — Density-Ratio Support Gate Primitive

**Status:** IN FLIGHT — from Research 604 (arXiv:2610.02126 Local Support Learning), GOAT verdict (downgraded from SUPER-GOAT at round 1) 2026-10-03. Modelless; feature `gmm_support` (opt-in until GOAT, then promote/demote per the flag discipline).

## Goal

Ship the continuous-latent two-density support gate as a katgpt-core primitive by CONSUMING and EXTENDING shipped substrate (verdict round 1 — no parallel GMM type): extend the `RegionSubspaceField`-class Gaussian machinery with per-component variances + a logsumexp mixture density + EM refinement; seed EM from the shipped deterministic `fit_codebook_kmeans_into`; revive `JlProjectionMatrix` at E=256; add the pos/neg ratio gate, EMA smoother, and the offline excess-mass certification validator. Consumers: reflex fused-abstain density half (riir-reflex Issue 066), healer continuous ScopeModel sibling, riir-engine `LoRAHotSwap` gated dispatch (guide `riir-ai/.research/394`), vessel-packed per-phase artifacts.

- [ ] T0 — substrate consume-or-extend map (REWRITTEN per verdict round 1): `RegionSubspaceField` (Plan 416 — centroids, log_pi, SHARED psi_inv, sigmoid membership gates, BLAKE3 commitment) · `fit_codebook_kmeans_into` (factorized_action — deterministic Lloyd + k-means++, no GD) · `JlProjectionMatrix` (shard_embedding — deprecated at m=8 for JL-bound breakage, Issue 139; SOUND at E≥256) · `data_probe/gaussianity.rs` (`sketched_gaussianity`, feature `gaussianity_probe`) · `GaussianMixtureSpace` (fixture-grade, NOT a gate). Re-grep at implementation time for anything newer.
- [ ] T1 — mixture-density extension of the RegionSubspaceField class: per-region diagonal VARIANCES (psi per region, not shared), `loglik_mixture(&[f32; E]) -> f32` in log-space `logsumexp` form (the shipped `membership_gates` is per-region sigmoid, not a mixture density), zero-alloc eval path; artifact commitment REUSING `compute_field_commitment`'s format (extended fields appended in pinned order). **Fit-space law (see Measured constraint): the mixture is fit/eval'd in the PROJECTED E-space, never raw D-space.**
- [ ] T2 — EM refinement (`em_refine`): E-step responsibilities from the mixture density; M-step closed-form (means, per-region variances, weights); seeded FROM `fit_codebook_kmeans_into` (k-means++ init, the shipped no-GD constructor); fixed data order, iteration-capped; determinism pinned by BLAKE3 artifact hash (same input bytes → identical artifact).
- [ ] T3 — `JlProjector`: revive `JlProjectionMatrix` at E=256 (de-gate the deprecation path or add a thin E≥256 constructor); seeded Rademacher; deterministic apply `project(&[f32; D], &mut [f32; E])`; **packed sign-bit storage** (verdict round 2: one bit per entry, applied with add/sub only — at batch-1 decode the projection is memory-bandwidth-bound and sign bits make its weight reads near-free; also the natural fit for the ternary/Bonsai direction); hash pinned; distortion probe test (JL bound sanity on a fixture set); the Issue-139 m=8 history carried in the doc comment so nobody re-shrinks it.
- [ ] T4 — `SupportGate`: holds `pos` + `neg` mixture densities (neg shared per shape class); `log_ratio(&[f32; E]) -> f32`; `open(&x) -> bool` (hard) and `confidence(&x) -> f32` = `sigmoid(log_ratio / τ)` (sigmoid, never softmax); unfitted/empty = closed-always (the `CorpusDistanceGate` empty-corpus precedent); mid/scale knobs consumer-pinned with POC-scale defaults named as such.
- [ ] T5 — `GateSmoother`: per-stream EMA state `s ← α·g + (1−α)·s` with `decide(threshold=0.5)`; plain struct (per-stream runtime state, never synced, never a weight).
- [ ] T6 — Certification validator (`certify` behind the same feature): excess/deficit probe battery — fit on corpus A, probe on held-out A (deficit rate) + planted off-domain B (excess rate, measured as Φ_neg-WEIGHTED EXCESS MASS: sample the reference GMM, measure the open rate — Lebesgue volume is unmeasurable under unbounded Gaussians in 256-D, verdict round 1); **two-sided canary, leak BY CONSTRUCTION**: the discriminator-class control is a linear score fit on the same features, and the planted B probes sit FAR OUT along the discriminator's positive normal (extrapolation region) so the leaky gate is GUARANTEED to open there — a test pins that the discriminator fires on those probes, else the instrument exits 2 (§3.6 discipline: a validator that cannot red is not a validator; a canary that reds by luck is not a canary).
- [ ] T7 — Bound-acceptance check (RESTATED per verdict round 1): on the SYNTHETIC fixtures (T8) where the true P is known, estimate excess mass by sampling Φ_neg and compare to the ε predicted from the known fixture P (the App-E L1→bound relation, fixture-scoped); arms at low-D and at E=256; monotonicity arm (bigger ε ⇒ bigger excess within slack). No real-corpus volume claims.
- [ ] T8 — Deterministic corpus fixture: fixed-seed synthetic activation corpora (in-support GMM blob + off-domain probes + a generic-reference blob + the discriminator extrapolation probes T6 needs), BLAKE3-pinned, reused by every gate below.
- [ ] T9 — Bench `bench_gmm_support_gate`: G2 latency with the projection COUNTED (verdict round 1) — per-request consumer posture: one projection + one GMM-pair eval per request vs the request's own decision pass (assert ≤ a few %); per-matrix posture: the per-matrix overhead sits AT the expected cost (q/k/v shared ~11–12%, o_proj ~16%, down_proj ~15–16% of the gated path), so per-single-matrix bars would be decided by noise (verdict round 2) — assert at LAYER or FORWARD-PASS scope with gates shared across same-input matrices (q/k/v, gate/up): added layer latency ≤ 12% vs the ungated adapter path, or set the bar from the first measurement if the shared-input grouping differs (first-measurement arithmetic, reviewer-verified at verdict close: with r=128 adapters + q/k/v and gate/up sharing, gates ≈ 7% of a Qwen2.5-1.5B layer — the fixed K=32/E=256 cost matters more on smaller models; check 0.5B in Plan 439's pilot); G4 alloc canary (counting allocator, `black_box`-defended); throughput at K∈{2,16,32} × E=256.
- [ ] T10 — GOAT gate run (all of G1–G5 from Research 604 §GOAT, including G5's two-sided canary and the UQ conformal-naive floor on `confidence` outputs); record in `.benchmarks/`; promote `gmm_support` to default ONLY if all pass (flag discipline).
- [ ] T11 — Doc: `.docs/` entry + README feature-table row + this plan's status update; PASS-Redirects hygiene (grep `2610.02126` must hit this note).
- [ ] T12 — Consumer wiring handoffs (separate repos, NOT in this plan's compile surface): reflex Issue 066 (abstain density half), riir-refine ScopeModel sibling (guide row), riir-engine gated `LoRAHotSwap` dispatch (guide row). Each lands in its own repo with its own gates.

## Non-goals

- No in-model conditional-LoRA forward (that is riir-infer-laya feature material, gated on riir-train Plan 439's pilot).
- No fp16/int8 GMM quantization this pass (recorded as a follow-up row in Research 604; artifact bytes already KB-class).
- No streaming moment drift-sentinel (B3) — record as future issue if a serving consumer asks.

## Risks

- EM determinism across platforms (float summation order): pin the reduction order; artifact hash is the regression tripwire.
- τ/κ defaults are POC-scale (the `contrastive_scope` precedent): consumers re-pin; the bench asserts sensitivity only, not universal optima.

## Measured constraint (consumer-side evidence, 2026-10-04)

**The GMM must be fit in the PROJECTED space — raw hashed-bag embedding space REJECTS
Gaussianity universally.** Measured at the first consumer (riir-reflex Issue 066
PRE-CHECK, reflex `bd18b86`, `examples/gaussianity_probe.rs` consuming
`data_probe/gaussianity.rs::sketched_gaussianity` on the real seat-corpus embedding
populations — whole-corpus + per-label, deterministic, two runs byte-identical):

- raw 256-d hashed-bag space: **0/154 per-label pools accept** (median score 0.0000 on
  every suite) — a diagonal-GMM fit there models a distribution the data provably is
  not;
- JL projection (Rademacher ±1/√k) at **k=64 rescues it: 253/254 pools accept,
  median ≥ 0.95, k-stable across 64/32/16**;
- whole-corpus pools stay REJECTED on many-label suites (massive 60 labels,
  banking77 77) even projected — the label-mixture multimodality the per-label
  components exist to model (this is T1/T2's component structure working as designed,
  not a blocker).

Consequences for this plan: T1/T2 fit ONLY post-T3-projection inputs (the `JlProjector`
is a hard prerequisite of any real-data fit, not an optional accelerator); T6/T7
validators and T9 benches that use real-corpus-like fixtures must project first or
their Φ references are meaningless; T12 consumer handoffs carry the same law (a
consumer fitting in raw space will measure a gate that is wrong by construction).
